    "# Text Analytics for Customer Care\n",
    "\n",
    "# Seminar goals:\n",
    "In this project, we will work on Text Analytics applied to Customer Care. These methodologies are broadly used in business to multiple use cases as:\n",
    "- Identify **leaknesses** in Customer services\n",
    "- Identify **unsatisfied customers**\n",
    "- Identify **potential issues** \n",
    "- Automate the customer-company interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "During this project we will follow the end-to-end Machine Learning process: from data gathering and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and prediction, and finally, data visualization in order to identify potential unsatisfied customers, main topics related with a given product, etc.. In particular, the main sections of this project are:\n",
    "1. Data understanding and preparation: exploration of the dataset and feature engineering\n",
    "2. Text processing: clean and transform the text in order to improve our model accuracy\n",
    "2. Model Training: training a Sentimental Analysis Model. Analysis of metrics (recall, precision, confusion metrics)\n",
    "3. Creating a Business opportunity with Machine Learning: selection of the best model and identification of the most important features\n",
    "4. Create the Customer Care dashboard: Build up an interactive dashboard in order to convert data into easily consumable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do you have to deliver?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code**: This Jupyter completed with your code\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Some exercises will require an interactive visualization that can be done in any platform (Tableau, Power BI, ...). The only requirement is: if it is not done in Tableau or Power BI you must provide a full guideline about how to install it and any other thing required to use it.\n",
    "- **Report**: A PDF where you expose your conclusions to those questions remarked with **[REPORT]**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 0. Context: Using Machine Learning applied to text to improve Customer Care services\n",
    "\n",
    "We work as a head of data science and AI in a Ecommerce company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Customer Services Department takes a long time to process all the information they have and detect unsatisfied customers. Therefore, they came to us and ask for a platform that solves their problem: automate the data extraction, process the data and deliver the output in a dashboard that they can consume with the objective of being able to detect the unsatisfied customers, the main topics why they are unsatisfied, see the customer's history, and many other graphs that help them to improve the Customer Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.1 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working with a kaggle dataset that is composed by two datasets: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Product Reviews**\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains the review done by a customer for a given product. Its fields are the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ReviewTitle**: Title of the review\n",
    "- **ReviewBody**: Contains the review done by the customer\n",
    "- **ReviewStar**: How many stars the customer assigns to the product. From 0 to 5, where 0 is the worst value and 5 the best one.\n",
    "- **Product**: Product identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Product Info**\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains the info about a given product. Its fields are the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MRP**: Unknown (non used)\n",
    "- **Price**: price of the product\n",
    "- **ProductFullName**: Full name of the product\n",
    "- **ProductShortName**: Short name of the product. This is the one that join the product with all reviews it has.\n",
    "- **ReviewURL**: URL to see the product description\n",
    "- **id**: Unique identifier of the product."

In case our product is good and customers like it, then the hypothesis is that the main words that they will use are positive words (good, fine, awesome, like ...). And in the opposite case, if customers are unsatisfied with the product, the main words should be negative words (awful, bad, ...).\n",
